# Robotics---Control-of-Mobile-Robot
This repository contains my implementation of the programming asssignments of Control of Mobile Robots course delivered by Georgia Institute of Technology on Coursera

## 1. Mobile Robot Simulator
The programming exercises use a simulated version of a robot called the QuickBot. The simulated QuickBot is equipped with five infrared (IR) range sensors, of which three are located in the front and two are located on its sides. The simulated QuickBot has a two-wheel difierential drive system (two wheels, two motors) with a wheel encoder for each wheel. You can build the QuickBot yourself by following the hardware videos located under the Course Resources tab.
